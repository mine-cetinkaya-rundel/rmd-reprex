```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
```

This is needed for any chunk in the document.

```{r load-pkg}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Question 1

And here is some other code that is required for the next chunk:

```{r create-iris-modified}
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(
    sepal_ratio = Sepal.Width / Sepal.Length,
    petal_ratio = Petal.Width / Petal.Length
    )
```

And here is another problematic chunk, with an actual error. `s`pecies should be 
`S`pecies.

```{r plot-ratios}
ggplot(iris_modified, aes(x = sepal_ratio, y = petal_ratio, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Question 2

Below is some code that has is not required to run the next chunk.

```{r plotsepal-width-length}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_point()
```

And here is the chunk in question. Should have used `summarise()` not `mutate()`
is the answer.

```{r calculate-mean-sw}
iris %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  mutate(mean_sw = mean(Sepal.Width))
```
